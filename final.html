	<p><font color="red" size="100px">W</font> e all know politics is about power and as feminist theory famously posits, the personal is political. While our clothing reflects who we are, in many ways it can also determine our ability to gain entry into influential spaces. Yet when women express an interest in fashion, it is often weaponized as a means of denying us access to political conversations—as if these interests were mutually exclusive.</p>

	<p>Teen Vogue became a target of this strain of chauvinism during our coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign and election. I quickly earned a bull’s-eye for my work covering everything from Ariana Grande’s shoes to Donald Trump’s lies—the fashion and entertainment articles were routinely used by dissenters on Twitter to call my intelligence into question and disqualify my political coverage. The most grotesque example was broadcast on national television last year when a male Fox News host abruptly ended our politically charged debate by telling me to “stick to the thigh-high boots.”</p>

	<p>The notion that enjoying fashion precludes the potential for critical thought espouses an absurd double standard with obvious roots in sexism. Despite what the critics may say, you are allowed to obsess over a pair of shoes while maintaining a passionate investment in the future of this country. As a woman who cares about both, I wanted to arm myself—and every young woman who reads Teen Vogue—with a new way to think about fashion’s role in the context of politics.</p>

	<p>Speaking with a range of designers, I find the answer unfailingly turns to personal agency and its sartorial extensions. <blockquote cite="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/fashion-is-political-period"><p>Designer Mara Hoffman immediately sweeps my existential question into a big-picture reality, explaining that how she exists in the world as a woman is political: “Life is political.... Walking through this planet is political.” (I immediately envision clips of her simple yet profound statement plastered on one of those third-wave feminist T-shirts. We’ll get to those later.)</p></blockquote><p>In a world where good old boys’ clubs prevail and victim-blaming persists, the way a woman decides to adorn her body can alter the course of her life. How many times have we heard wearing a miniskirt equated with asking for it? For women navigating traditionally male fields (read: most of them), the daily practice of dressing can also be a professional and political minefield.</p></p>

	<p class="bigandred">"You are allowed to obsess over a pair of shoes while maintaining a passionate investment in the future of this country."</p>

	<p>Tory Hoen, the creative director of brand marketing for MM.LaFleur, a high-end line that customizes professional women’s wardrobes, told me about the brand’s clients’ desire to not make their outfits the center of the conversation. <blockquote cite="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/fashion-is-political-period"><p>“Many of our clothes are functional and beautiful but don’t necessarily steal the spotlight,” Tory said. “Our customers are often the only women in a room full of men, and dressing in unassuming garments is the most efficient way to steer the conversation away from what she's wearing."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Consider as well the plight of female politicians who are disproportionately harangued for their fashion decisions and then chastised for claiming to care about them at all. Hillary Clinton was endlessly nitpicked in the press for her sensible pantsuits, while her male counterparts’ sartorial choices were limited to the selection of a red or blue necktie.The cultural significance of fashion and its sexist double standards are undeniable, but evaluating the industry’s role in a politicized world is much more nuanced. If “wokeness” is emerging as the new social currency, some designers are responding with earnest attempts at weaving politically motivated messages into their work. After the election, DSW’s slogan #MarchOn seemed to allude to the Women’s March. Luxury brands like Dior and Prabal Gurung responded to the turmoil of Donald Trump’s rise by incorporating the language of the resistance directly into their ready-to-wear collections.</p>

	<p>As clever and relevant as these decisions may be, some critics argue that profiteering has no place in the resistance. Even brands that explicitly embrace liberal values can be seen as merely flirting with the trendy aesthetics of activism by slapping slogans on T-shirts and co opting suffering for a shot at increased relevance, often without the business practices to match the liberal messaging. (For the record: Rocking a dad hat with the word “feminism” embroidered on it is not empowering anyone if it’s made in a sweatshop by a company without a single female executive on its board.) I asked Prabal how he would respond to criticism of co-opting movements for commercial gain. After all, even well-intentioned designers hoping to use their platform to make a difference are still trying to sell clothes at the end of the day. He answered thoughtfully, detailing his environmentally friendly policies, his equal-opportunity hiring practices, and the inclusion of plus-size items that began with the inception of his company eight years ago. “I always ask myself: What is the legacy I’m going to leave behind?” he said.</p>

	<p>In speaking with Prabal and other ethically driven members of the fashion community, the answer to escaping superficial activism emerged: Customers must investigate the DNA of the companies they patronize and act in a way that rewards brands whose wokeness extends beyond their marketing campaigns. Don’t underestimate the force of your intellect or your wallet in addressing the issues you care about. Bottom line: The only requirement for expressing your politics is being informed; this applies to future shopping sprees and the next time a middle-aged man tries to tell you what you can and cannot talk about.</p>
